# Data Structures

A **data structure** is a named location that can be used to store and organize **data**. And, an **algorithm** is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning **data structures and algorithms** allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

Some example of **Abstract Data Structure** are :

* [Tree](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/introduction-to-binary-trees)
* Graph
* [Stack](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/stack-data-structure), [Queue](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/queue-data-structure) etc.

Learning Data-Structures is an important part of a CS student and it is rigorous to understand in one go needs a lot of practice and hand's on problem solving to be an expert.
